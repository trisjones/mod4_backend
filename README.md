# Weather backend
A current and 5-day weather forecast app for people on the go.

## Motivation
The purpose of this project was to gain experience building Rails backends that can be integrated with React clients.

## Tech used
- Rails
- Postgres

## Setup
- Clone down this repo and run `bundle install`.
- Once this has completed and all dependencies are installed, run `rails s`.
- Visit [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/). You'll only see the Rails welcome screen but this indicates that the http request was successful and the API is ready to serve the client.
- Now, visit the [Weather client](https://github.com/Jessicalong627/weather-app) and follow the setup instructions to get the Weather app's frontend running.
